Code Naming Guidlines

- Variable names are written in snake_case and are descriptive of their purpose.
- Constants are written in uppercase
- Comments are used to explain important blocks of code.
- Code is organized in a modular manner, with reusable code blocks imported where necessary.
- No unnecessary wait functions that make the test run longer than it should.
- Follow a naming convention for test titles that starts with `test_` and provides a clear description of the test scenario. We provide test titles in the brief.
